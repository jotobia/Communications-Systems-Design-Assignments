The attached waveform includes one of 16 possible signals plus noise. 

If the signals is 4 bits long determine the signal using auto or
cross correlation. 

A “1” is indicated by 1 volt, a “0” by -1 volt. The signal is 40 points long.
Each bit is 10 points long. The 41 st point starts a new sequence.
