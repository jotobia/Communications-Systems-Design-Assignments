Using Matlab, calculate and plot the Fourier Series of a rectangular wave with a frequency of 1 Hz and duty cycle of 30%

The waveform represents a “1” when it is above 0.5 V and a “0” when it is at a lower voltage.

Then by altering the harmonics, introduce an error to the binary signal by making digital signal dip below 0.5 V halfway through its ON time.
